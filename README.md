# Sustainablinds project
This was created by Ethan Posner, Sebastien Van Den Bremt, and Jasper Charlinski for the Technation Open Innovation Challenge, which can be found [here](https://technationcanada.agorize.com/en).

This project is a simple website containing a dashboard which can be used to optimally control window blinds in a building with the purpose of reducing heating and cooling energy used. For now, it only displays a concept of how this could be achieved, but in the future, we aim to do this by using automated window blinds connected
to a central hub.

To view the website, visit [https://enprogames.github.io/sustainablinds/](https://enprogames.github.io/sustainablinds/).
